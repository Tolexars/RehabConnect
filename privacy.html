    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., for legal, tax, or accounting purposes). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
